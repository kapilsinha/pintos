                                COMMAND SHELL
                                =============

---- LOGISTICS ----

These questions will help us to keep track of the difficulty level of
assignments, as well as keeping track of which team members worked on
which parts.

>> L1: How many hours did each team member spend on this assignment?
Joseph: 15 h
Kapil: 20 h
Karthik: 15 h

>> L2: What did each team member focus on for this assignment?  Keep
   descriptions to 25-30 words or less.

Kapil focused on parsing the command and tokenizing it into an array. Kapil also
wrote the code to execute a command using execvp() after appropriately setting
its input and output.
Joseph focused on putting the tokenized commands into an array of structs and
also did some of the error handling.
Karthik focused on the IO redirection, implementing pipes, and the main loop
although Joseph and Kapil later helped with debugging the issues with the pipes.
General debugging like fixing memory likes and open file descriptors was done by
all members of the team.

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Describe how your command shell manages parsing and executing
>> commands that contain arguments and pipes, using the example
>> command "a arg1 arg2 | b arg1 | c arg1 arg2 arg3".  How does your
>> shell internally represent such a command?
The command is first tokenized into an array which is split up by spaces or tabs
and "|", "<", ">", or ">>" symbols. Following the example given, the tokenized
array would be:

[a, arg1, arg2, |, b, arg1, |, c, arg1, arg2, arg3]

This tokenized array is then put into an array of structs where the struct is
defined as follows:

typedef struct command {
    int input;
    int output;
    int error;
    int num_args;
    char **args;
} Command;

Following the example given, we would create the following three structs (one
for each command since we separate commands by pipes):

c1 : {STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, STDERR_FILENO, 2, [a, arg1, arg2]}
c2 : {STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, STDERR_FILENO, 1, [b, arg1]}
c3 : {STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, STDERR_FILENO, 3, [c, arg1, arg2, arg3]}

These three structs are then put into an array which is [c1, c2, c3].
Since the length of this array is greater than 1, we know that there are
multiple commands and we need to be using pipes. We can then loop over the
commands array from left to array while creating pipes as needed. We then
fork() to avoid interfering with the IO for the shell itself which acts as the
parent. In the child process, we use dup2() to duplicate the file descriptor of
the pipe and then execute using execvp().

>> A2: Now, given the command:
>> "a arg1 arg2 < inp.txt | b arg1 | c arg1 arg2 arg3 > out.txt"
>> Briefly explain specifically how the redirections are parsed and
>> represented, and by what processes.

We split up the commands by pipes which is the "|" symbol. We then treat each
command separately and assume any input after a command is an argument unless we
see a "<", ">", or ">>" symbol. We assume the first word/argument is the command
to be executed until we see a pipe in which case we set the word/argument right
after the pipe to be the current command. If we see any of the symbols
specified, we update the command struct accordingly to set the input or output.
If we do not see any of these symbols, then we just set input and output to the
default values which are STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, and STDERR_FILENO.
We set the fields of the command struct to the file descriptor returned after
opening the file. All of this is done in the parent which is the shell itself.

When we begin looping over the array of command structs, we fork() before
executing the command. This creates a child which uses dup2() to set the
standard input or standard output of the process to the desired file. It then
executes the process. We fork before setting the standard input and standard
output to prevent interfering with the IO of the shell.
While looping over the array of command structs, if the length of the array is
greater than 1, this implies that we need pipes. We open the pipes in the parent
since we need two separate children to be able to access the same pipe and a
parent can only wait for its children to terminate and not its grandchildren.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A3: Illustrate how you solved the problem of setting up
>> redirection in a simple command like "a < inp.txt > out.txt", by
>> describing what process takes care of the redirection and when.
We parse the command as explained above where we assume any values

>> A4: Illustrate how you solved the problem of setting up the pipes
>> between multiple operations in a single command, by describing
>> what each process is responsible for.  For example, given the
>> command "a | b | c", describe the sequence of steps in setting up
>> the processes and their pipes, starting with your command shell's
>> process, and going through the execution of programs a, b and c.
>> Keep your description of each process' responsibilities limited to
>> ~25 words or less.

>> A5: Similarly, describe the details of how terminated processes are
>> reaped in the example command "a | b | c".

>> A6: Similarly, describe which processes are responsible for setting
>> up the redirections in the example command
>> "a < inp.txt | b | c > out.txt".

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A7: Why must the chdir and exit commands be implemented as built-in
>> functions, rather than external programs?

>> A8: Why did you ultimately choose this design?  In what ways is it
>> superior to other designs you considered as you developed your solution?

>> A9: Did you take any steps to facilitate development of the command
>> shell in parallel, e.g. designing shared data structures or integration
>> points up front?  How well did your approach work for your team?  Feel
>> free to share any positive or negative experiences in this vein.

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future years.  Feel free to tell us anything you want - these
questions are just to spur your thoughts.  Also, feel free to be completely
honest if there are issues with the assignment or the course - you won't be
penalized.  We can't fix things until we know about them.  :-)
