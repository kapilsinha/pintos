>> A2: What is the maximum size of a file supported by your inode
>> structure?  Show your work.

    The maximum size of a file supported by our inode structure is
    16,524 * 512 = 8,460,288 bytes. This is because given our structure, we can
    have 12 direct blocks, 128 indirect blocks, and 128 * 128 double indirect
    blocks which adds up to 16,524.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A3: Explain how your code avoids a race if two processes attempt to
>> extend a file at the same time.

    We added an extension lock to our inode struct which must be acquired
    anytime a process tries to read a file, write to a file, or extend a file.
    This prevents two processes from extending the same file at the same time.

>> A4: Suppose processes A and B both have file F open, both

    We added an extension lock to our inode struct. This lock must be acquired
    for both reads and writes. For reads, the lock is simply acquired to check
    if we are trying to read past the end of the file. This keeps A from reading
    while B is extending the file because B holds this extension lock until it
    is completely done extending the file and writing all of its data.

>> A5: Explain how your synchronization design provides "fairness".

    We implemented our own shared-exclusive lock which is used whenever trying
    to read or write to a cache entry. Our lock implementation does not allow
    an additional reader if writers are waiting to keep writers from getting
    starved.
    Since we have a shared-exclusive lock, readers can never block other
    readers. Also, since when a writer releases the lock, it broadcasts to all
    readers to allow them to read, and until this set number of permitted
    readers are done reading, no other writers are allowed access to the lock.
    This way, neither readers nor writers can get starved.

    Yes, our inode structure is a multilevel index. We tried to keep our
    implementation as simple as possible and therefore kept the number of
    direct, indirect, and doubly indirect blocks to a minimum. Thus, we used
    12 direct blocks, 1 indirect block, and 1 doubly indirect block.

};

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how your cache replacement algorithm chooses a cache
>> block to evict.

    We implemented the clock eviction policy to determine which cache entry to
    evict. We initialize the "clock hand" to point to the first entry of the
    cache table. When choosing a policy to evict, we first check the entry
    pointed to by the "clock hand". If it is marked as accessed, we clear it and
    move on to the next entry. Otherwise, we return it.

>> C3: Describe your implementation of write-behind.

>> C4: Describe your implementation of read-ahead.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> C5: When one process is actively reading or writing data in a
>> buffer cache block, how are other processes prevented from evicting
>> that block?

    Our evict_block function tries to acquire the read/write lock as a writer
    and the eviction lock. This keeps a process from evicting the block while it
    is being accessed because it would get blocked on trying to acquire the
    read/write lock.

>> C6: During the eviction of a block from the cache, how are other
>> processes prevented from attempting to access the block?

    When the evict_block function is evicting an entry from the cache, it tries
    to acquire the read/write lock as a writer which means that it tries to
    get exclusive access to the entry. This keeps other processes from trying
    to read this entry or write to it.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C7: Describe a file workload likely to benefit from buffer caching,
>> and workloads likely to benefit from read-ahead and write-behind.

    If a process is repeatedly reading and writing to the same part of the file,
    it would benefit from buffer caching because having a buffer cache would
    reduce the number of times the process needs to access the disk. However, if
    instead the process is looping through a fairly large file which has a size
    greater than the buffer cache and reading and writing as it goes, it would
    benefit more from read-ahead and write-behind because reading in the next
    sector into the cache would speed up looping through the file.
