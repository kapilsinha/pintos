			   USER PROGRAMS
			   =============

---- LOGISTICS ----

These questions will help us to keep track of the difficulty level of
assignments, as well as keeping track of which team members worked on
which parts.

>> L1: How many hours did each team member spend on this assignment?
   Make sure that each member's total time is listed.
   Karthik Nair: 70 h
   Kapil Sinha: 70 h

>> L2: What did each team member focus on for this assignment?  Keep
   descriptions to 25-30 words or less.
   Karthik focused on implementing the execution system calls and file system
   calls.
   Kapil focused on implementing argument passing and setting up the stack.
   Both Karthik and Kapil worked on implementing waiting for a process, and
   also spent much time debugging to fix the various syscalls (issues ranging
   from logical issues, accessing garbage after a child dies, more minor bugs,
   and memory inefficiency issues resulting from using page_alloc as opposed
   to malloc).
   

                           ARGUMENT PASSING
                           ================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct child_process {
    struct thread *child;    /* Pointer to the child thread. */
    /* Child_tid is necessary in addition to the child pointer because
     * the child tid must persist after the child may have exited, in
     * order to properly wait */
    int child_tid;           /* Tid of the child. */
    struct semaphore signal; /* Semaphore to signal child has executed. */
    int exit_status;         /* Exit status of the child. */
    /* Semaphore to force thread to yield to its child so it can load */
    struct semaphore load_sema;        
    /* Semaphore to force thread to yield to its parent after loading */
    struct semaphore parent_load_sema;
    /* true if thread loaded succeeded, false otherwise */
    bool is_load_successful; 
    struct list_elem elem; /* Linked list element */
};

The above child_process struct allows a parent thread to keep track of all of its
children, which is necessary for waiting and to generate a tid based on whether
the program loaded.

/* Struct for file descriptors of this thread. */
struct file_descriptor {
    int fd;                /* Integer file descriptor for this file. */
    char *file_name;       /* Name of file. Used to check if file is open. */
    struct file *file;     /* Pointer to the file struct for this file. */
    struct list_elem elem; /* Linked list element. */
};

The above struct is used by a thread to keep track of its open files, so we
can check if a thread has already opened a file (so we know whether to
create a new inode or simply map a file struct to a pre-existing inode).

The following members were added to the thread struct:

struct list children;     /*!< List of immediate children of this thread. */
struct thread *parent;     /*!< Pointer to the parent thread. */

struct list files;       /*!< List of file descriptors for files opened
                              by this thread. */
int fd_next;             /*!< fd of the next opened file by this thread */

The list of children was added to allow a thread to keep track of its children
and know the exit status of its child threads. We added a pointer to the parent
for our thread_get_child_process function which takes a tid and then loops over
the children of the thread passed in.
We also added a list of open files to the thread struct and a counter for the
next file descriptor, to handle the file syscalls for a given thread.



---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
We avoided strtok_r to have more control of our own memory management.
We iterated over the file/command and first calculated the number of 
arguments (based on whitespace) and then parsed the arguments by
concatenating adjacent arguments and separating them by a null char.
We then subtracted the stack pointer esp by this length and added this
concatenated series of arguments at once. Thus, we were able to add the
arguments in reverse order on the stack by simply adding them all at the
same time.
Then of course, we added the word alignment, pointers to the words (which
simply involved another loop over our arguments to get their addresses),
pointer to argv[0], and argc (which we calculated earlier).
>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?
To accommodate a program in one page, we require space for:
1. All arguments - char_count + word_count
2. Word alignment - WORD_SIZE - 1 < WORD_SIZE
3. Pointer to each arg - word_count * sizeof(char *)
4. Pointer to the pointer to argv[0] - sizeof(char *)
5. argc - sizeof(int)
6. Return address / esp / extra padding - WORD_SIZE
If a program does not fit in the sum of these sizes, we simply fail to
load the program. Thus there is no chance for overflow. We do not allow
any program to take up more than one page of stack space (though we could
with relative ease, modify this).

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----
